# Configure Client Credentials
Some {{prodname}} activities, such as installation require authenticated access to the {{prodname}} API.
These activities can be performed by users logging into the UI, but in some cases it is more convenient to automate these activities.
Client Credentials are used to authenticate these automated activities.

As an administrator, you can create, modify and delete Client Credentials.

To configure Client Credentials in the UI, follow these steps
1. Select the user icon  > Client Credentials
1. Click the `Add Client Credentials` button
1. Enter a name for the Client Credentials
1. Select the relevant roles. (The only role available currently is "{{prodname}} Installer")
1. Click the `Save` button
1. Locate the newly created Client Credentials in the list and select **Action** > **Manage keys** > **Add**
1. Enter a name for the key
1. Select the expiry duration
1. Click the `Save` button
1. Download the secret and store it in a secure location. You will not be able to retrieve the secret again.

To rotate a Client Credentials Key in the UI, follow these steps
1. Select the user icon  > Client Credentials
1. Locate the value in the list and select **Action** > **Manage keys** > **Add**
1. Enter a name for the key
1. Select the expiry duration
1. Click the `Save` button
1. Download the secret and replace the existing secret in your Secret Management System with the new one.
1. Once the new secret has been updated and rolled out, you can delete the old Key by selecting **Action** > **Manage keys**, locate the key to delete and click **X**

To delete a Client Credentials in the UI, follow these steps
1. Select the user icon  > Client Credentials
1. Locate the value in the list and select **Action** > **Manage keys** > **Delete**

Note that once a Client Credentials is deleted, any requests authenticated by the associated secrets will be rejected.



**TODO: waiting on the UI to be finished to confirm the above is correct**
