# Upgrade Calico Cloud

To upgrade managed clusters to the latest version of {{prodname}}:

**Clusters that were installed by generating the installation command in the UI must be upgraded in the same manner**

1. In Manager UI, go to **Managed Clusters**.
1. For the cluster you want to upgrade, select **Actions** > **Reinstall**.
1. Select the version of {{prodname}} you want to install, you can select the currently installed version, or any newer supported version
1. Click **Next**, copy the command, and apply it to appropriate cluster.

**Cluster that were installed using automation workflows can be upgraded by replacing the version in the {{prodname}} Installer manifest**

The exact steps will depend on your workflows, the following shows how to upgrade the version using `kubectl`:
```shell
kubectl -n calico-cloud patch installer default --type=json \
  -p '[{"op": "replace", "path": "/spec/calicoCloudVersion", "value": "v19.2.0"}]'
```
